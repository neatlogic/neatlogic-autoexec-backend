.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This Module is intended to provide
an interface to the strongest available source of non-blocking 
randomness on the current platform.  Platforms currently supported are
anything supporting /dev/urandom and versions of Windows greater than 
or equal to Windows 2000.
.SH "SUBROUTINES/METHODS"
.IX Header "SUBROUTINES/METHODS"
.ie n .IP """urandom""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWurandom\fR" 4
.IX Item "urandom"
This function accepts an integer and returns a string of the same size
filled with random data.  The first call will initialize the native 
cryptographic libraries (if necessary) and load all the required Perl libraries
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
.ie n .IP """No secure alternative for random number generation for Win32 versions older than W2K""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWNo secure alternative for random number generation for Win32 versions older than W2K\fR" 4
.IX Item "No secure alternative for random number generation for Win32 versions older than W2K"
The module cannot run on versions of Windows earlier than Windows 2000 as there is no
cryptographic functions provided by the operating system.
.ie n .IP """Could not import CryptAcquireContext""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCould not import CryptAcquireContext\fR" 4
.IX Item "Could not import CryptAcquireContext"
The module was unable to load the CryptAcquireContextA function from the 
advapi32 dynamic library.  The advapi32 library cannot probably be loaded.
.ie n .IP """CryptAcquireContext failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCryptAcquireContext failed\fR" 4
.IX Item "CryptAcquireContext failed"
The module was unable to call the CryptAcquireContextA function from the
advapi32 dynamic library.
.ie n .IP """Could not import CryptGenRandom""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCould not import CryptGenRandom\fR" 4
.IX Item "Could not import CryptGenRandom"
The module was unable to load the CryptGenRandom function from the 
advapi32 dynamic library.
.ie n .IP """Could not import SystemFunction036""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCould not import SystemFunction036\fR" 4
.IX Item "Could not import SystemFunction036"
The module was unable to load the SystemFunction036 function from the 
advapi32 dynamic library.

.el .IP "\f(CWThe length argument must be supplied and must be an integer\fR" 4
.IX Item "The length argument must be supplied and must be an integer"
The get method must be called with an integer argument to describe how many
random bytes are required.
.ie n .IP """CryptGenRandom failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCryptGenRandom failed\fR" 4
.IX Item "CryptGenRandom failed"
The Windows 2000 CryptGenRandom method call failed to generate the required
amount of randomness
.ie n .IP """RtlGenRand failed""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWRtlGenRand failed\fR" 4
.IX Item "RtlGenRand failed"
The post Windows 2000 RtlGenRand method call failed to generate the required
amount of randomness
.ie n .IP """Only read n bytes from path""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWOnly read n bytes from path\fR" 4
.IX Item "Only read n bytes from path"
The /dev/urandom device did not return the desired amount of random bytes
.ie n .IP """Failed to read from path""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWFailed to read from path\fR" 4
.IX Item "Failed to read from path"
The /dev/urandom device returned an error when being read from
