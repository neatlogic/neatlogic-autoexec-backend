.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fINet::SSH::Perl::Auth::RSA\fR performs \s-1RSA\s0 authentication with
a remote sshd server. When you create a new \s-1RSA\s0 auth object,
you give it an \fI\f(CI$ssh\fI\fR object, which should contain an open
connection to an ssh daemon, as well as any data that the
authentication module needs to proceed. In this case, for
example, the \fI\f(CI$ssh\fI\fR object might contain a list of \s-1RSA\s0
identity files (see the docs for \fINet::SSH::Perl\fR).
.PP
The \fIauthenticate\fR method first tries to establish a connection
to an authentication agent. If the connection attempt is successful,
the client loops through the identities returned from the agent,
and tries each identity/key against the server. The client enters
into a dialog with the server. The client sends the public portion
of the key returned from the agent. The server responds, telling the
client whether the key is authorized for authentication; if the
key is authorized, the server sends an \s-1RSA\s0 challenge encrypted with
the user's public key. The client then asks the agent to decrypt the
challenge using the private portion of the key, and sends back its
response. If the response is correct, the client is authenticated
successfully.
.PP
If the client cannot connect to the authentication agent, or if none
of the identities returned from the agent successfully authenticate
the user, \fIauthenticate\fR then loops through each of the files listed
as identity files (see the \fINet::SSH::Perl\fR constructor). If no
identity files are explicitly listed, \fI\f(CI$ENV\fI{\s-1HOME\s0}/.ssh/identity\fR
is used as a default. For each identity, the client enters into
a dialog with the sshd server.
.PP
The client sends the public key to the server, then waits for
a challenge. Once this challenge is received, the client must
decrypt the challenge using the private key (loaded from the
identity file). When loading the private key, you may need
to enter a passphrase to decrypt the private key itself; first
\&\fIauthenticate\fR tries to decrypt the key using an empty
passphrase (which requires no user intervention). If this
fails, the client checks to see if it's running in an
interactive session. If so, it queries the user for a
passphrase, which is then used to decrypt the private key. If
the session is non-interactive and the private key cannot
be loaded, the client simply sends a dummy response to the
\&\s-1RSA\s0 challenge, to comply with the \s-1SSH\s0 protocol.
.PP
Otherwise, if the private key has been loaded, and the
challenge decrypted, the client sends its response to the
server, then waits for success or failure.
