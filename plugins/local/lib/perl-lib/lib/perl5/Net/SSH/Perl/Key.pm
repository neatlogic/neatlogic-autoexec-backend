=head1 NAME

Net::SSH::Perl::Key - Public or private key abstraction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::SSH::Perl::Key;
    my $key = Net::SSH::Perl::Key->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Net::SSH::Perl::Key> implements an abstract base class interface
to key objects (either DSA or RSA keys, currently). The underlying
implementation for RSA is an internal, hash-reference implementation;
the DSA implementation uses I<Crypt::DSA>.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Net::SSH::Perl::Key->new($key_type [, $blob [, $compat_flag_ref ]])

Creates a new object of type I<Net::SSH::Perl::Key::$key_type>,
after loading the class implementing I<$key_type>. I<$key_type>
should be either C<DSA> or C<RSA1>, currently; these are the
only supported key implementations at the moment.

I<$blob>, if present, should be a string representation of the key,
from which the key object can be initialized. In fact, it should
be the representation that is returned from the I<as_blob> method,
below.

I<$compat_flag_ref> should be a reference to the SSH compatibility
flag, which is generally stored inside of the I<Net::SSH::Perl>
object. This flag is used by certain key implementations (C<DSA>)
to work around differences between SSH2 protocol implementations.

Returns the new key object, which is blessed into the subclass.

=head2 Net::SSH::Perl::Key->read_private($key_type, $file [, $pass])

Reads a private key of type I<$key_type> out of the key file
I<$file>. If the private key is encrypted, an attempt will be
made to decrypt it using the passphrase I<$pass>; if I<$pass>
is not provided, the empty string will be used. An empty
passphrase can be a handy way of providing password-less access
using publickey authentication.

If for any reason loading the key fails, returns I<undef>; most
of the time, if loading the key fails, it's because the passphrase
is incorrect. If you first tried to read the key using an empty
passphrase, this might be a good time to ask the user for the
actual passphrase. :)

Returns the new key object, which is blessed into the subclass
denoted by I<$key_type> (either C<DSA> or C<RSA1>).

=head2 Net::SSH::Perl::Key->keygen($key_type, $bits)

Generates a new key and returns that key. The key returned is
the private key, which (presumably) contains all of the public
key data, as well. I<$bits> is the number of bits in the key.

Your I<$key_type> implementation may not support key generation;
if not, calling this method is a fatal error.

Returns the new key object, which is blessed into the subclass
denoted by I<$key_type> (either C<DSA> or C<RSA1>).

=head2 Net::SSH::Perl::Key->extract_public($key_type, $key_string)

Given a key string I<$key_string>, which should be a textual
representation of the public portion of a key of I<$key_type>,
extracts the key attributes out of that string. This is used to
extract public keys out of entries in F<known_hosts> and public
identity files.

Returns the new key object, which is blessed into the subclass
denoted by I<$key_type> (either C<DSA> or C<RSA1>).

=head2 $key->write_private([ $file [, $pass] ])

Writes out the private key I<$key> to I<$file>, and encrypts
it using the passphrase I<$pass>. If I<$pass> is not provided,
the key is unencrypted, and the only security protection is
through filesystem protections.

If I<$file> is not provided, returns the content that would
have been written to the key file.

=head2 $key->dump_public

Performs the inverse of I<extract_public>: takes a key I<$key>
and dumps out a textual representation of the public portion
of the key. This is used when writing public key entries to
F<known_hosts> and public identity files.

Returns the textual representation.

=head2 $key->as_blob

Returns a string representation of the public portion of the
key; this is I<not> the same as I<dump_public>, which is
intended to match the format used in F<known_hosts>, etc.
The return value of I<as_blob> is used as an intermediary in
computing other values: the key fingerprint, the known hosts
representation, etc.

=head2 $key->equal($key2)

Returns true if the public portions of I<$key> are equal to
those of I<$key2>, and false otherwise. This is used when
comparing server host keys to keys in F<known_hosts>.

=head2 $key->size

Returns the size (in bits) of the key I<$key>.

=head2 $key->fingerprint([ I<$type> ])

Returns a fingerprint of I<$key>. The default fingerprint is
a hex representation; if I<$type> is equal to C<bubblebabble>,
the Bubble Babble representation of the fingerprint is used
instead. The former uses an I<MD5> digest of the public key,
and the latter uses a I<SHA-1> digest.
