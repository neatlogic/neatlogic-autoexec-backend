=head1 NAME

MongoDB::ReadPreference - Encapsulate and validate read preferences

=head1 VERSION

version v2.2.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MongoDB::ReadPreference;

    $rp = MongoDB::ReadPreference->new(); # mode: primary

    $rp = MongoDB::ReadPreference->new(
        mode     => 'primaryPreferred',
        tag_sets => [ { dc => 'useast' }, {} ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A read preference indicates which servers should be used for read operations.

For core documentation on read preference see
L<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/read-preference/>.

=head1 USAGE

Read preferences work via two attributes: C<mode> and C<tag_sets>.  The C<mode>
parameter controls the types of servers that are candidates for a read
operation as well as the logic for applying the C<tag_sets> attribute to
further restrict the list.

The following terminology is used in describing read preferences:

=over 4

=item *

candidates – based on C<mode>, servers that could be suitable, based on C<tag_sets> and other logic

=item *

eligible – these are candidates that match C<tag_sets>

=item *

suitable – servers that meet all criteria for a read operation

=back

=head2 Read preference modes

=head3 primary

Only an available primary is suitable.  C<tag_sets> do not apply and must not
be provided or an exception is thrown.

=head3 secondary

All secondaries (and B<only> secondaries) are candidates, but only eligible
candidates (i.e. after applying C<tag_sets>) are suitable.

=head3 primaryPreferred

Try to find a server using mode "primary" (with no C<tag_sets>).  If that
fails, try to find one using mode "secondary" and the C<tag_sets> attribute.

=head3 secondaryPreferred

Try to find a server using mode "secondary" and the C<tag_sets> attribute.  If
that fails, try to find a server using mode "primary" (with no C<tag_sets>).

=head3 nearest

The primary and all secondaries are candidates, but only eligible candidates
(i.e. after applying C<tag_sets> to all candidates) are suitable.

B<NOTE>: in retrospect, the name "nearest" is misleading, as it implies a
choice based on lowest absolute latency or geographic proximity, neither which
are true.

The "nearest" mode merely includes both primaries and secondaries without any
preference between the two.  All are filtered on C<tag_sets>.  Because of
filtering, servers might not be "closest" in any sense.  And if multiple
servers are suitable, one is randomly chosen based on the rules for L<server
selection|MongoDB::MongoClient/SERVER SELECTION>, which again might not be the
closest in absolute latency terms.

=head2 Tag set matching

The C<tag_sets> parameter is a list of tag sets (i.e. key/value pairs) to try
in order.  The first tag set in the list to match B<any> candidate server is
used as the filter for all candidate servers.  Any subsequent tag sets are
ignored.

A read preference tag set (C<T>) matches a server tag set (C<S>) – or
equivalently a server tag set (C<S>) matches a read preference tag set (C<T>) —
if C<T> is a subset of C<S> (i.e. C<T ⊆ S>).

For example, the read preference tag set C<< { dc => 'ny', rack => 2 } >>
matches a secondary server with tag set C<< { dc => 'ny', rack => 2, size =>
'large' } >>.

A tag set that is an empty document – C<< {} >> – matches any server, because
the empty tag set is a subset of any tag set.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 mode

The read preference mode determines which server types are candidates
for a read operation.  Valid values are:

=over 4

=item *

primary

=item *

primaryPreferred

=item *

secondary

=item *

secondaryPreferred

=item *

nearest

=back

=head2 tag_sets

The C<tag_sets> parameter is an ordered list of tag sets used to restrict the
eligibility of servers, such as for data center awareness.

The application of C<tag_sets> varies depending on the C<mode> parameter.  If
the C<mode> is 'primary', then C<tag_sets> must not be supplied.

=head2 max_staleness_seconds

The C<max_staleness_seconds> parameter represents the maximum replication lag in
seconds (wall clock time) that a secondary can suffer and still be
eligible for reads. The default is -1, which disables staleness checks.

If the C<mode> is 'primary', then C<max_staleness_seconds> must not be supplied.
