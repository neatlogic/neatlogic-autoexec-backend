Crypt-OpenSSL-AES version 0.02
==============================

This is Crypt::OpenSSL::AES version 0.02, an XS-wrapper around
OpenSSL's AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) library.

This module is an alternative to the implementation provided by
Crypt::Rijndael which implements AES itself. In contrast, this
module is simply a wrapper around the OpenSSL library.

The Crypt::Rijndael implementation seems to produce inaccurate
results on 64-bit x86 machines.  By using OpenSSL, this module
aims to avoid architecture specific problems, allowing the OpenSSL
maintainers to overcome such issues.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires OpenSSL with AES support to be installed.

This module has only been tested with OpenSSl version 0.9.7a
and with Perl version 5.8.5 on both 64-bit and 32-bit x86 machines.
