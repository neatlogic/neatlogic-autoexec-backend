Revision history for Perl extension Config-Tiny:

2.23  Wed Oct 14 09:11:00 2015
	- Add the utf8 BOM to this file. Let's hope the CPAN toolchain can cope. If it can't, another
		version of the code will have to be released.
	- Fix read() and write() so they work on files called '0' (zero). See RT#107754.
		Many thanx to Григорий Кудренко for the report and patch.
	- Add t/05.zero.t and t/0 to test the new code.
	- Reformat the source slightly.

2.22  Tue Feb 17 08:32:00 2015
	- Fix licence info in Makefile.PL to say Perl.

2.21  Mon Feb 16 08:59:00 2015
	- Patch Makefile.PL to refer to the current repo, which is on github, and not the original one,
		which is on Adam's web site. See RT#102125.
	- Remove Build.PL because Karen Etheridge tells me Module::Build is no longer in core.
		See RT#102126.
	- Edit line lengths in this file to a max of 100 chars.
	- Edit line lengths in the docs the same way.
	- Expand the See Also section of the docs.

2.20  Sun Nov 24 10:52:00 2013
	- Relax pre-req version requirements

2.19  Sun Sep 15 09:16:00 2013
	- Change VERSION => $VERSION in Makefile.PL to VERSION_FROM => 'lib/Config/Tiny.pm'.
		Reported by Jean-Louis Morel. See RT#88670.

2.18  Sat Sep 14 10:03:00 2013
	- Remove obsolete and wrong version # from Makefile.PL.
		Reported by Jean-Louis Morel. See RT#88658.
	- Implement Kevin Ryde's suggestion to test if read() will return undef.
		If so, set an error message and (still) return undef.

2.17  Fri Sep 13 12:41:00 2013
	- Remove the file tests -efr during calls to read(). The open() tests for any error.
		Also, the -f test was reporting /dev/null as a directory, not a file.
		Thanx to Kevin Ryde for pushing me to implement this. See RT#36974.
	- Clean up some error messages slightly.

2.16  Fri Sep  6 11:54:00 2013
	- Replace Path::Tiny with File::Spec, because the former's list of dependencies is so long :-(.
		Changed files: t/02.main.t, t/04.utf8.t, Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
		See: RT#88435 (for Tree::DAG_Node) for an explanation.

2.15  Sun Aug  4 14:59:00 2013
	- Clean up the shambolic dates in this file.
	- Add a note under Caveats about setting options more that once. Only the first case is
		respected. Thanx to Kimmel K. See RT#69795.
	- Add a $encoding parameter to read_file() and write_file(). See docs for details.
		Add t/04.utf8.t and t/04.utf8.txt.
		Thanx to Mark Lawrence and Wolfgang Husmann. See RT#71029 and RT#85571.
	- For BSD-based systems, when writing a file during tests, use:
		my($temp_dir) = File::Temp -> newdir('temp.XXXX', CLEANUP => 1, EXLOCK => 0, TMPDIR => 1);
	- Rename t/*.t files. I use '.' rather than '_' in file names because the latter is a shift
		char.
	- Add MANIFEST.SKIP, Changelog.ini, Build.PL, META.json.
	- Add an FAQ to the docs.
	- Clean up the docs.

2.14 Thu Mar 24 12:00:00 2011

	- Resolved #30479: does not warn or die when writing data it
	  cannot later.
