Comments= <<EOT
- Add the utf8 BOM to this file. Let's hope the CPAN toolchain can cope. If it can't, another
version of the code will have to be released.
- Fix read() and write() so they work on files called '0' (zero). See RT#107754.
Many thanx to Григорий Кудренко for the report and patch.
- Add t/05.zero.t and t/0 to test the new code.
- Reformat the source slightly.

[V 2.21]

Comments= <<EOT
- Patch Makefile.PL to refer to the current repo, which is on github, and not the original one,
which is on Adam's web site. See RT#102125.
- Remove Build.PL because Karen Etheridge tells me Module::Build is no longer in core.
See RT#102126.
- Edit line lengths in this file to a max of 100 chars.

[V 2.19]
Date=2013-09-15T09:16:00

[V 2.18]
Date=2013-09-14T10:03:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Remove obsolete and wrong version # from Makefile.PL.
Reported by Jean-Louis Morel. See RT#88658.
- Implement Kevin Ryde's suggestion to test if read() will return undef.
If so, set an error message and (still) return undef.
EOT

[V 2.17]
Date=2013-09-13T12:41:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Remove the file tests -efr during calls to read(). The open() tests for any error.
Also, the -f test was reporting /dev/null as a directory, not a file.
Thanx to Kevin Ryde for pushing me to implement this. See RT#36974.
- Clean up some error messages slightly.
EOT

[V 2.16]
Date=2013-09-06T11:54:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Replace Path::Tiny with File::Spec, because the former's list of dependencies is so long :-(.
Changed files: t/02.main.t, t/04.utf8.t, Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
See: RT#88435 (for Tree::DAG_Node) for an explanation.
EOT

[V 2.15]
Date=2013-08-04T14:59:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Clean up the shambolic dates in this file.
- Add a note under Caveats about setting options more that once. Only the first case is
respected. Thanx to Kimmel K. See RT#69795.
- Add a $encoding parameter to read_file() and write_file(). See docs for details.
Add t/04.utf8.t and t/04.utf8.txt.
Thanx to Mark Lawrence and Wolfgang Husmann. See RT#71029 and RT#85571.
- For BSD-based systems, when writing a file during tests, use:
my($temp_dir) = File::Temp -> newdir('temp.XXXX', CLEANUP => 1, EXLOCK => 0, TMPDIR => 1);
- Rename t/*.t files. I use '.' rather than '_' in file names because the latter is a shift
char.
- Add MANIFEST.SKIP, Changelog.ini, Build.PL, META.json.
- Add an FAQ to the docs.
- Clean up the docs.
