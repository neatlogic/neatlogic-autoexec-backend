    - Return filehandle close() value to caller. Spotted in
      Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Big by Edward James and
      Reidar Johansen.

    - Changed IO::Scalar from a "use" to a "require" and removed
      the Makefile dependency to make H. Merijn Brand's life easier
      for some reason. :-)


0.13  Sun Aug 1 2004

    - Allowed use of user defined filehandles. This should make the
      module work with mod_perl and some other applications.
