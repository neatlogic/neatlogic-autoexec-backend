NAME
    Perl::OSType - Map Perl operating system names to generic types

VERSION
    version 1.010

SYNOPSIS
      use Perl::OSType ':all';

      $current_type = os_type();
      $other_type = os_type('dragonfly'); # gives 'Unix'

DESCRIPTION
    Modules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if the
    current operating system matches a more generic type of operating
    systems. For example, 'linux' is a type of 'Unix' operating system and
    so is 'freebsd'.

    This module provides a mapping between an operating system name as given
    by $^O and a more generic type. The initial version is based on the OS
    type mappings provided in Module::Build and ExtUtils::CBuilder. (Thus,
    Microsoft operating systems are given the type 'Windows' rather than
    'Win32'.)

USAGE
    No functions are exported by default. The export tag ":all" will export
    all functions listed below.

  os_type()
      $os_type = os_type();
      $os_type = os_type('MSWin32');

    Returns a single, generic OS type for a given operating system name.
    With no arguments, returns the OS type for the current value of $^O. If
    the operating system is not recognized, the function will return the
    empty string.

  is_os_type()
      $is_windows = is_os_type('Windows');
      $is_unix    = is_os_type('Unix', 'dragonfly');

    Given an OS type and OS name, returns true or false if the OS name is of
    the given type. As with "os_type", it will use the current operating
    system as a default if no OS name is provided.
