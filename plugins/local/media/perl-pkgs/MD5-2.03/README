This module is depreciated.  Please use Digest::MD5 instead.

This module (MD5.pm) is just a thin wrapper around the Digest::MD5
module.  It is provided so that legacy code that rely on the old
interface continue to work with the speed benefit of the new module.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
The Digest::MD5 module must be installed.
