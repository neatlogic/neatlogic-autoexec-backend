Add more tests to the test suite; add SSH2 tests.

Fixes to SSH2 implementation:
    * get rid of dummy shell channel (if possible)
    * more documentation
    * anything currently marked XXX in the code

Compatibility with NetScreen?

Switch over to using Crypt::RSA for SSH1 RSA implementation?
SSH2 RSA keys now use Crypt::RSA; at this point it might just
be too much extra baggage to try to force people to use
Crypt::RSA, because it has so many prereqs.

Switch completely to Math::Pari? Worthwhile? Again, don't
want existing SSH1 users to have to switch.

Use non-blocking connect, like IO::Socket, to implement a
connect Timeout.

A proper scp client.

Port forwarding.
