Config::Properties
==================

Description
-----------

Config::Properties is a near implementation of the java.util.Properties API.
It is designed to allow easy reading, writing and manipulation of Java-style
property files.

The format of a Java-style property file is that of a key-value pair seperated
by either whitespace, the colon (:) character, or the equals (=) character.
Whitespace before the key and on either side of the seperator is ignored.
	
Lines that begin with either a hash (#) or a bang (!) are considered comment
lines and ignored.

A backslash (\) at the end of a line signifies a continuation and the next
line is counted as part of the current line (minus the backslash, any whitespace
after the backslash, the line break, and any whitespace at the beginning of the next line).

When a property file is saved it is in the format "key=value" for each line.

Read the POD documentation for more fine details!
