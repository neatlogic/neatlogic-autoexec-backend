IO::String is an IO::File (and IO::Handle) compatible class that read
or write data from in-core strings.  It is really just a
simplification of what I needed from Eryq's IO-stringy modules.  As
such IO::String is a replacement for IO::Scalar.

Installation as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Documentation is embedded in the module.
