2005-12-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.08

   The untie code in close() just seemed wrong, so just
   remove it.  The object still seems to get cleaned up
   on various versions perl.

   Release 1.06

   Make seek() return TRUE when it succeed.  It used to
   return the new position, but we want to be compatible with
   the builtin seek().
   Patch contributed by Kurt M. Brown <kurtb149@yahoo.com>

   Make print() and printf() return TRUE even when printing
   the empty string.  The used to return the lenght of the string
   printed, but now they always return 1 to be compatible with
   the builtins.

   Make binmode() return TRUE unless layers are provided.
