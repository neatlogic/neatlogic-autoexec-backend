    . Fix the test for PMC loading to work on versions on Perl that don't
      have Config::non_bincompat_options (HAARG). Fixes RT#102626 .

0.233 20150525
    ! The diagnostic about inheriting from ourselves was removed.
      It served no own purpose as Perl already warns if we try to
      inherit in a circular way.

0.232  20150319
    . Change line-endings in parent-pmc.t to unix EOLs so that bleadperl
      is happy
    . No code changes, no need to upgrade

0.231  20150309
    . Really restore test compatibility where Perl does not provide
      &Config::non_bincompat_options. This affected Perl
      versions < 5.14 (RT #102626, patch by Matthew Horsfall)
    . No code changes, no need to upgrade

    . Applied a docpatch by Robin Barker to fix the documentation
      about the warning of inheriting from yourself.
      Fixes RT #66459

0.224  20101031
    . Change assignment @ISA = (@ISA, 'new::class')
      to use push @ISA, 'new::class'
      This should make class creation faster from 5.10 onwards
      and reverts a change made in 2.14. If this is critically slow for you
      and you can't upgrade your version of Perl, use the old way.

0.223  20090901
    . No functional changes, no need to upgrade

0.217  20070815
    + Fixed test failure reported by David Cantrell
    + Ripped out most of the logic. All you can do
      is now specify that the base classes should not
      be loaded from a file via C<-norequire>.
    + 5.004 compatibility restored by Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni
      (mostly it's the test suite that breaks ...)

0.216 20070805
