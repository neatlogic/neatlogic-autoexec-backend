NAME
    Test::RequiresInternet - Easily test network connectivity

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::More;
      use Test::RequiresInternet ('www.example.com' => 80, 'foobar.io' => 25);

      # if you reach here, sockets successfully connected to hosts/ports above
      plan tests => 1;

      ok(do_that_internet_thing());

OVERVIEW
    This module is intended to easily test network connectivity before
    functional tests begin to non-local Internet resources. It does not
    require any modules beyond those supplied in core Perl.

    If you do not specify a host/port pair, then the module defaults to
    using "www.google.com" on port 80.

    You may optionally specify the port by its name, as in "http" or "ldap".
    If you do this, the test module will attempt to look up the port number
    using "getservbyname".

    If you do specify a host and port, they must be specified in pairs. It
    is a fatal error to omit one or the other.

    If the environment variable "NO_NETWORK_TESTING" is set, then the tests
    will be skipped without attempting any socket connections.

    If the sockets cannot connect to the specified hosts and ports, the
    exception is caught, reported and the tests skipped.
