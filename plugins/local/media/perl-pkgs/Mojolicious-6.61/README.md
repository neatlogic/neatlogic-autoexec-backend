# Mojolicious [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kraih/mojo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kraih/mojo)

  Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl because of a
  wonderful Perl library called [CGI](https://metacpan.org/module/CGI). It was
  simple enough to get started without knowing much about the language and
  powerful enough to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun. While
  most of the techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not.
  Mojolicious is a new endeavor to implement this idea using bleeding edge
  technologies.

## Features

  * An amazing **real-time web framework**, allowing you to easily grow single
    file prototypes into well-structured web applications.
    * Powerful out of the box with RESTful routes, plugins, commands, Perl-ish
      templates, content negotiation, session management, form validation,
      testing framework, static file server, CGI/[PSGI](http://plackperl.org)
      detection, first class Unicode support and much more for you to
      discover.
  * A powerful **web development toolkit**, that you can use for all kinds of
    applications, independently of the web framework.
    * Full stack HTTP and WebSocket client/server implementation with IPv6, TLS,
      SNI, IDNA, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy, Comet (long polling), keep-alive, connection
      pooling, timeout, cookie, multipart, and gzip compression support.
    * Built-in non-blocking I/O web server, supporting multiple event loops as
      well as optional preforking and hot deployment, perfect for building
      highly scalable web services.
    * JSON and HTML/XML parser with CSS selector support.
  * Very clean, portable and object-oriented pure-Perl API with no hidden
    magic and no requirements besides Perl 5.22.0 (versions as old as 5.10.1
    can be used too, but may require additional CPAN modules to be installed)
  * Fresh code based upon years of experience developing
    [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org), free and open source.

## Installation

  All you need is a one-liner, it takes less than a minute.

    $ curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -M https://cpan.metacpan.org -n Mojolicious

  We recommend the use of a [Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) environment.

## Getting Started

  These three lines are a whole web application.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' => {text => 'I ♥ Mojolicious!'};

app->start;
```

  To run this example with the built-in development web server just put the
  code into a file and start it with `morbo`.

    $ morbo hello.pl
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    I ♥ Mojolicious!

## Duct tape for the HTML5 web

  Use all the latest Perl and HTML features in beautiful single file
  prototypes like this one, and grow them easily into well-structured
  applications.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;
use 5.20.0;
use experimental 'signatures';

# Render template "index.html.ep" from the DATA section
get '/' => {template => 'index'};

# WebSocket service used by the template to extract the title from a website
websocket '/title' => sub ($c) {
  $c->on(message => sub ($c, $msg) {
    my $title = $c->ua->get($msg)->res->dom->at('title')->text;
    $c->send($title);
  });
};

app->start;
__DATA__

@@ index.html.ep
% my $url = url_for 'title';
<script>
  var ws = new WebSocket('<%= $url->to_abs %>');
  ws.onmessage = function (event) { document.body.innerHTML += event.data };
  ws.onopen    = function (event) { ws.send('http://mojolicious.org') };
</script>
```
