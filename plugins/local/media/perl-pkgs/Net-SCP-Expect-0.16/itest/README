itest -> Interactive Test

Be sure to do perl Makefile.PL; make before starting this script.

There are three test files that will the test program will attempt to copy to
the remote host:

small_file.test
medium_file.test
large_file.test

The script will check their md5 sum on the remote side (if possible).

These files will then be deleted and an attempt will be made to copy them
back to your local filesystem.  If any of the tests fail, you may need to
manually remove the files from the remote host.

After this test has sucessfully finished I recommend deleting the .test files.

NOTES
=====
This test can take quite a while, depending on your connection speed.  At home
using my slow DSL connection (about 30k/s) it took about 45 minutes.
