This file contains the results of the File::Temp benchmark script
by File::Temp version, perl version and OS.

On Windows NT, currently have problems with this benchmark since it
runs into a file limit after a while (this is because unlinking of the
open file is deferred until the end of the program rather than closing
it and unlinking it explcitly round the loop).

Times are in CPU seconds.

1. A 600 MHz pentium III running RedHat 6.1

2. A Sparc Ultra 1 running Solaris 2.6. /tmp local, /var/tmp on NFS
   (/var/tmp is the default temp location on Solaris and is used by 
    POSIX::tmpnam whereas /tmp is used by File::Temp since that is the
    location specified by File::Spec)

3. DEC 3000 Alpha running digital unix 4.0.
