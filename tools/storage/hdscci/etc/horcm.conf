# NAME   : A sample HORCM_CONF file for the Raid Manager.
#
#/********************* NOTE for System Operation *****************************/
#
# 1.Configuration definition file changes
#   If a system configuration changes or a RAID configuration change cause this
#   file to change, (e.g. cache size change or microcode change), these changes 
#   will not take effect until you stop HORCM (horcmshutdowm.sh) and restart 
#   HORCM (horcmstart.sh).  Use the "-c" option to pairdisplay command to 
#   verify that there are no configuration errors.
#
# 2.Usable range of command devices 
#   A command device is identified via "-CM"(e.g. OPEN-3-CVS-CM) in the
#   ProductID field of the SCSI standard inquiry data.
#   Each Raid Manager command is executed by issuing a specific command to  
#   a command device. Such a control command is only recognized as such 
#   when it is read from or written to a specific block area of the
#   command device LDEV.  Therefore, a command device can't be used for user 
#   data or be part of an LVM Volume Group (VG).

# HORCM_MON is a parameter which is used for monitoring and communicating.
# It describes the IP address, port number, and paired volume error monitoring
# interval of the local host.
#
# <ip_address>
# Describes a network address used by the local host. When HORCM has two or 
# more network addresses on different subnets, enter "NONE" here.
# For binding as IPv6 including IPv4, enter "NONE6" here.
#
# <service>
# Specifies the UDP port name assigned to the HORCM communication path 
# which is registered in "/etc/services".
# A port number or a port name can be specified. 
# 
# <poll>
# Specifies the interval for monitoring volume pairs. By making this interval 
# longer, the HORCM daemon load on the host is reduced.  If this interval is 
# set to -1, the paired volumes are not monitored. A value of -1 should be 
# specified when two or more HORCMs run on the same  host (i.e. volumes 
# are already monitored by another instance). 
# 
# <timeout>
# Specifies the maximum time-out period for communication with the remote 
# host.

# The HORCM_CMD parameter is used to describe the raw (UNIX) special file(s)
# used to access the command devices. The command devices must be mapped to 
# a SCSI/Fibre port (path) using the RAID SVP. Up to 16 instances can share 
# one command device using the same SCSI port. Beyond 16 instances, you could 
# still utilize the same command device as long as its via a different 
# SCSI/Fibre port(path).
# 
# List two or more command devices on the same line in order to use the command
# device alternating function for a particular array. 
# The '-C' and '-D' options to the horcctl command can be used to display the
# current command device or switch to a different one.
# The protection mode command device is shown by adding '*' to the device file.
# [Example]
# horcctl -D
# Current control device = /dev/sdo*
# 
# <dev_name>
# Specifies the raw special files to be used as command device.  
# Commands are issued to the array through these command devices. 
# [Example]
# dev_name                 dev_name                dev_name
# /dev/sde                 /dev/sdf
#
# [Note]:
# Handling of multiple command devices at HORCM startup:
# If only one (of several) command devices is available at HORCM startup,
# the startup log ($HORCM_LOG/horcm_HOST.log) will contain a warning.
# You needs to confirm that HORCM has started without warnings in the startup
# log (and that "horcctl -C" has successfully changed the command device).
#
# When one Raid Manager (host) connects to more than one array, the
# HORC Manager identifies each RAID by using its unitID as an additional
# identifier. The unitIDs are used in ascending order.

# This parameter is used to designate the SCSI/Fibre logical unit number (LU#).

# [Note]:
# In case of fibre channel (e.g. AIX), if the target ID & LU# displayed

# The mirror descriptor column (MU#) is often the key to deciphering the intent

# a "0" MU# explicitly implies BC (HOMRCF). If the BC (HOMRCF) mirroring
# (identical LU) descriptor (MU#0-2) is omitted, it is assumed to be MU#0.
# SVOL cascading (second tier) mirrors are expressed as virtual volumes using
# the mirror descriptors (MU#1-2). MU#0 is reserved for a first tier pvol/svol.
# MU# for HORC/UR
# MU#(0-3) identifies one of 4 possible HORC/UR bitmap associations for an LDEV.
# UR mirror description is described in the MU# column by adding "h" in order to
# identify identical LU as the mirror descriptor for UR. If omitted,
# it is assumed to be MU#0 for HORC/UR, MU# for HORC must be specified as "0".

# <ip_address>
# This parameter is used to describe the network address of the remote host

# [Note]:
# This configuration must be used in Non-protection mode.
# If the fibre channel adapter is used on HOST_X (HOST_Y), then the target ID
# which is indicated by the raidscan command may be different from the target
# ID shown by HOST_X (HOST_Y).
# In this case, the target ID & LU# indicated by the raidscan command should
# be used.
# Also, you will be able to change the fibre conversion table the following
# way to match the OS on HOST_X (HOST_Y). 
# [Example on HST_SUP]
# HORCMFCTBL=X          /*  'X' is Fibre conversion table Number  */
# export HORCMFCTBL
# horcmstart.sh 0 1     /*  Start HORCM  */
#
#/************************* For the first start-up ****************************/
# Please use your horcm.conf without comment lines for the first start-up 
# of HORCM !!
